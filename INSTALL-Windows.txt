Installation Instructions
*************************

Build Dependencies
==================

- Download and install `Visual C++ 2015 CTP 5 version 14.0.22512.0.DP` from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2967191
- Download and install PostgreSQL 9.4.1 from http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
  This may be optional in some cases, but you probably want them
       * Pick a directory for the database
       * Set an admin password for the database
       * Accept the default port (5432)
       * Accept `default` for the locale (not clear if anything depends on this. The `default` locale will presumably depend on your
         operating system's setting might cause inconsistencies)
       * Add `c:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.4\bin` to the $PATH (else the test
          will fail to find `libpq.dll`)

  If the installation fails, look into `$TEMP/install-postgresql.log` for hints.
  
- Download and install cygwin from https://cygwin.com/install.html
       * Get cygwin setup to install `Flex` and `Bison`
       * Add `c:\cygwin\bin` to the end of `$PATH`
  This is to compile `xdrc`'s `parse.yy` and `scan.ll` which have custom 
  compilation commands referring to `bison` and `flex` via the `$PATH`


Basic Installation
==================

- `git clone ...`
- `git submodule init`
- Open the solution Builds\VisualStudio2015\stellarx.sln
- Visual Studio will offer to upgrade from v120 to v140. Agree.
- Pick the target architecture and flavor (e.g. x64, Release)
- Hit "Build Solution (F7)"
