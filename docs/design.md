#Left to design:
- Bucket list
- memo in txs
- should we make payments that go through the same orderbook in the same ledger cross each other?
	- this will make things way more complicated but could potentially increase the liquidity a lot.
- freezing credit/compliance


Things we know we probably want to add later but design earlier than later
to avoid churn on the protocol front:
- some common place to look up tx memos, multisig txs, etc
- private transactions
- scripting
