#Left to design:
- Bucket list


#Left to do:
- items blocking function
 - Random TODOs in the code (jed)
 - Tests for FBA (stan)
 - Tests for transactions (nicolas)
 - ledger header needs to be stored in the DB (nicolas)
 - Syncing to the network (graydon)
 - Replaying transactions to catch up (graydon)
 - storing history (graydon)
 - bucket list (graydon)
- non blocking items
 - saving peers in the DB (jed)
 - sending round lists of peers (jed)
 - deal with bad acting peers (jed)
 - stress test
 - End to end tests, replaying a known set of tx  
 - inflation tx (nicolas)
 - store validations in the DB
 - fuzzer



Things we know we probably want to add later but design earlier than later
to avoid churn on the protocol front:
- private transactions
- scripting
