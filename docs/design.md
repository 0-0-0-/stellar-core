Left to design:
-Bucket list
-currency codes
-number format


Left to do:
-txs should adjust the ledger header
-ledger header needs to be stored in the DB
-Syncing to the network
-saving peers in the DB
-storing history
-bucket list 
-deal with many tx from same account in the same ledger
-inflation tx
-Tests for FBA
-Tests for transactions
-End to end tests
-fuzzer
-stress test



Things we know we probably want to add later:
-multisig accounts
-private transactions
-scripting
