Left to design:
-Bucket list

Left to do:
-ledger header needs to be stored in the DB
-Syncing to the network
-saving peers in the DB
-sending round lists of peers
-storing history
-bucket list 
-deal with many tx from same account in the same ledger
-store validations in the DB
-inflation tx
-Tests for FBA
-Tests for transactions
-End to end tests
-fuzzer
