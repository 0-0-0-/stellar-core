Left to design:
-Bucket list
-currency codes
-number format


Left to do:

[items blocking platform work]

-Tests for FBA
-Tests for transactions

-ledger header needs to be stored in the DB

-saving peers in the DB
-sending round lists of peers

-Syncing to the network
-Replaying transactions (catch up)
-storing history
-bucket list 

-deal with many tx from same account in the same ledger

[non blocking platform]

-stress test
-End to end tests

-inflation tx
-store validations in the DB
-fuzzer



Things we know we probably want to add later but design earlier than later
to avoid churn on the protocol front:
-multisig accounts
-private transactions
-scripting
