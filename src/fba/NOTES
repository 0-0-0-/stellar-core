Outstanding questions for @dm:
------------------------------

- attemptValue semantics
If our node already emitted a PREPARE message for a ballot (0,x) it received
from another node. What should be the behaviour if the local user of FBA wants
to attempt another value y. Can it just emit a new PREPARE message with ballot
(0,y) since the abort pledges it represents are exactly the same.

- isPrepared implementation
Please check the code and let's discuss any error you find there  

- processEnvelope semantics
When I receive a PREPARED message from a node, I opportunistically update the
old PREPARE message for that same node by setting the optional prepared ballot
to the current ballot. The goal is to be able to only consider PREPARE
envelopes to determine if an excepted ballot is aborted in isPrepared() (see
abortedFilter)
