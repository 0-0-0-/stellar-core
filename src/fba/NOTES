Outstanding questions for @dm:
------------------------------

- attemptValue semantics
If our node already emitted a PREPARE message for a ballot (0,x) it received
from another node. What should be the behaviour if the local user of FBA wants
to attempt another value y. Can it just emit a new PREPARE message with ballot
(0,y) since the abort pledges it represents are exactly the same.

=> OK if y>x

[x] TESTCASE: x<y prepare(0,x), attemptValue(0,y)

- isPrepared implementation
Please check the code and let's discuss any error you find there  

- V-blocking incompatible PREPARED (Q: 3 out of 4)
1: PREPARE (1,x) - PREPARED (1,x)
2: PREPARE (1,x) - PREPARED (1,x)
3: PREPARE (1,y) - ?
4: PREPARE (1,x) - DIE
> Can 3 move onto PREPARED(1,y) directly? Should it?
=> Yes but cant COMMIT (1,y) if x<y. Won't for now in implementation as this is
   not a requirement

[x] TESTCASE: attemptValue (1,x) then receive PREPARE/PREPARED (1,y)

- PREPARED by ballot bigger (Q: 3 out of 4)
1: PREPARE (1,x) 
2: PREPARE (1,y) - PREPARED (1,y)                  
3: PREPARE (1,y  - PREPARED (1,y)
4: PREPARE (1,y)
> Emit PREPARE (1,y) PREPARED(1,y) COMMIT(1,y)

[x] TESTCASE: x<y, attempt(1,x) prepared(1,y)

- participation after externalization (x<y)
1: ... - COMMITTED (1,x) -               - COMMITTED (1,x)
2: ... - COMMITTED (1,x) -               - COMMITTED (1,x)
3: ... - COMMITTED (1,x) -               - COMMITTED (1,x)
4:    (4 is down)        - PREPARE (1,y) - COMMITTED (2,x)

[x] TESTCASE: committed message directly received. skip to externalization.
[x] TESTCASE: if committed send committed in response to messages
[x] TESTCASE: ignore previous ballot counter
[x] TESTCASE: cancelled pledge to commit

- COMMITTED (*,x) can't bump my ballot anymore but can only extenralize if
  ratified. Keep sending that message when I receive something.
