Outstanding questions for @dm:

- attemptValue semantics
If our node already emitted a PREPARE message for a ballot (0,x) it received
from another node. What should be the behaviour if the local user of FBA wants
to attempt another value y. Can it just emit a new PREPARE message with ballot
(0,y) since the abort pledges it represents are exactly the same.

Please check the code and let's discuss any error you find there
